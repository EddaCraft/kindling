# PocketFlow Integration

## Overview

PocketFlow is a lightweight workflow engine that provides explicit node boundaries and execution structure. Kindling uses PocketFlow's node lifecycle events to create high-signal memory capsules.

## Source

- **Repository**: https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Typescript
- **License**: MIT
- **Version**: Vendored (latest at time of copy)

## License Compatibility

PocketFlow uses the MIT license, which is compatible with Kindling's Apache-2.0 license:

- MIT allows commercial use, modification, distribution
- MIT requires license notice preservation
- No copyleft requirements that conflict with Apache-2.0

## Integration Approach

**Decision**: Vendored (copied in)

**Rationale**:
- PocketFlow is designed for vendoring (their intended model)
- No external dependency at runtime
- Full control over version and modifications
- MIT license explicitly permits copying
