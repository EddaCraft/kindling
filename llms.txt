# Kindling

> A lightweight library for adding durable memory and contextual continuity to AI-assisted workflows. Captures observations, organises into capsules, retrieves with provenance. Local-first, embedded SQLite, no external services.

Kindling is infrastructure — it captures context but does not assert truth. Governance and promotion belong to downstream systems (Edda).
